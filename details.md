This extension was created for the Netlify Compose 2024 Code Challenge.

## Add this extension to join the Compose Code Challenge

By adding this extension to your site, you'll be able to use edge includes and participate in the [Netlify Compose](https://netlify.com/compose) Code Challenge.

This will allow you to use edge includes in your site, pulling content into your pages from remote URLs on request like this:

```html
<!--
 This custom element will be replaced by the content returned from the href.
-->
<netlify-edge-include href="https://example.com/some-html">
</netlify-edge-include>
```

Note: This extension is not intended for production use beyond the scope of the Compose Code Challenge.
